# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: "none" # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/animations/
    - assets/lang/
    - .env

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-ExtraBold.ttf

    - family: Medium
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf

    - family: CM Sans Serif
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/cm_sans_serif_2012.ttf

    - family: Poppins-Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf

    - family: Poppins-Medium
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf

    - family: Poppins-Light
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Light.ttf

    - family: Poppins-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Poppins-Regular.ttf
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf

  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
